## Shopify Theme Detector

A Wordpress plugin to detect the shopify theme on a given website.

It exposes a shortcode `[shopify_inspector]` which spits out a form (with text input field) and submit button. The form expects the url of the shopify website which you're trying to analyze. 

Based on theme footprints on the page source, the plugin attempts to figure out the shopify theme.

[Here's a working example](https://proquotient.com/shopify-theme-detector/)
